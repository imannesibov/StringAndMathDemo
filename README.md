String25 & Math25 Utility Library

✨ Welcome to String25 & Math25! This is a Java console-based utility project that provides a collection of string
and number helper methods, useful for educational purposes and practicing Java programming concepts.

📝 Features

String25 Methods:
Convert numbers to words (numberToWord)
Toggle string case (toggleCase)
Check palindromes (isPolindrome)
Reverse strings (reverseStr)
Search for substrings (contains)
Append characters (appendWith)
Print characters, substrings, or arrays (printBy, printFrom, printArray)


Math25 Methods:
Calculate factorial (iterative & recursive) (factorialIterative, factorialRecursive)
Check for prime numbers (isPrime, displayPrime, displayPrimes)
Swap numbers without a temporary variable (swapWithoutTemp)
Sum digits of numbers (sumAll)
Check positive/negative numbers (isPositive)
Reverse integers (reversedInt)
Print powers of numbers (power)
Find missing numbers in sequences (findMissingNumbers)


💡 How to Use

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/imannesibov/StringAndMathDemo.git


Open the project in your favorite Java IDE (IntelliJ, Eclipse, etc.)

Run Main.java to see examples of the methods in action.

Uncomment the lines in Main.java to test different methods.


// Example usage:
String25.showMessage("Welcome! Let's get started.");
System.out.println(String25.numberToWord(1234));
Math25.displayPrimes(50);
